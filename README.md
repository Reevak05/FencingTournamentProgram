I referred to my past projects in case I needed to recall how to do something in Swing.

I used the [Java Swing documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/package-summary.html) to find methods and their parameters.

I looked through the classes in the Swing package to find methods and their parameters.

I also used StackOverflow a few times to find methods, but I did not mindlessly copy code from it.
